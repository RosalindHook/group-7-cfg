A requirements text file can help users set up the necessary environment to run a Python application.

It can contain:
- package names or libraries that a project relies on
- version specfiers

This file can be used to install the required packages and their specified versions by using the 
command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Here is an example of what a requirements.txt file might look like:

requests==2.25.1     # Install a specific version of the 'requests' library.
flask>=1.1.2         # Install 'flask' with a minimum version requirement.
numpy                # Install the latest version of 'numpy'.
pandas==1.3.4        # Use a specific version of 'pandas'.
matplotlib           # Install 'matplotlib' without specifying a version.
scikit-learn>=0.24.2 # Minimum version of 'scikit-learn'.
