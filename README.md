# Code Queens - Putting the 7 in Heaven

## **Hello ! My name is Olga.** :smile:
### I am very glad to be a member of such a wonderful team. 
* I love playing the piano and watching TV series. 
* I also love playing chess with my son._

## **Hi! I'm Ros...**

Here are a few things I like:
* I _love_ learning languages - both human and computer ones! I'm currently on a 173 day streak on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) :owl: learning Spanish :es: - and counting. 
* I also enjoy volunteering as a Cubs leader, leading weekly meetings ~~though maybe not right now because of the CFG degree taking up all my free time~~. 
* Like Olga, my children play chess :chess_pawn:. They usually beat me.
* I like :smile_cat: :heart_eyes_cat: and live with two, Bella and Cocoa, as well as a :dog: called Argo

## **:wave:Hello! I'm Sriya!**

Fun facts about me:
* :art: I love anything crafty and trying out new forms of art - I'm currently learning how to make ceramics.
* :walking: I enjoy playing badminton, hiking and have a brown belt in Karate.
* :coffee: As a coffee enthusiast, my main mission is to find the best coffee shop in london _(always welcome to recommendations)_[^1].
[^1]: _recommendation from Ros: [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4UJNnEso4bRPTXgc7) is great for a takeaway, just round the corner from my current office._

## **Hiya, I'm Rebecca.** :smile:

Like Ros, I also enjoy learning languages. I am learning Welsh on Duolingo and I try to speak it with my husband and daughter :heart:. ~~I am not very good at it though.~~

My favourite activity is taking my corgi, Gus, on a long walk along the beach. :ocean:

I also love cooking (and food in general :sushi: :pizza:).

My favourite quote is:
>"Women belong in all places where decisions are being made. It shouldn't be that women are the exception."

## **Collaborative approach and ways of working** :handshake:

Our team employed the following methods for effective collaboration on part 1 of this assignment:

1. **Zoom meetings:** We conducted regular Zoom meetings to discuss project requirements, share updates, and foster communication.

2. **Slack communication:** We maintained a dedicated Slack channel for real-time support and to distribute tasks among team members. Slack was also helpful in addressing issues, such as resolving merge conflicts. We broadly followed the process outlined in the following workflow diagram:

3. **Trello task management:** To keep our work organised and transparent, we used a Trello board. This board allowed us to track, assign, and manage tasks efficiently.

4. **Branch workflow:** Each team member contributed through separate branches. We followed a structured process of peer review and pull request merging to ensure the quality of our code and documentation.

5. **Sli.do Feedback:** We used Sli.do to gather feedback, collaborate, and reach consensus on our team name and slogan, ensuring that our decisions were collective and inclusive.
