## **Hello !. My name is Olga.**
### _I am very glad to be a member of such a wonderful team. I love playing the piano and watching TV series. I also love playing chess with my son._


## **Hi! I'm Ros...**

Here are a few things I like:
* I _love_ learning languages - both human and computer ones! I'm currently on a 173 day streak on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) :owl: learning Spanish - and counting. 
* I also enjoy volunteering as a Cubs leader, leading weekly meetings ~~though maybe not right now because of the CFG degree taking up all my free time~~. 
* Like Olga, my children play chess :chess_pawn:. They usually beat me.
* I like :smile_cat: :heart_eyes_cat: and live with two, Bella and Cocoa, as well as a :dog: called Argo

## **:wave:Hello! I'm Sriya!**

Fun facts about me:
* :art: I love anything crafty and trying out new forms of art - I'm currently learning how to make ceramics.
* :walking: I enjoy playing badminton, hiking and have a brown belt in Karate.
* :coffee: As a coffee enthusiast, my main mission is to find the best coffee shop in london _(always welcome to recommendations)_.


###**Hiya, I'm Rebecca.**:smile:

Like Ros, I also enjoy learning languages. I am learning Welsh on Duolingo and I try to speak it with my husband and daughter :heart:. ~~I am not very good at it though.~~

My favourite activity is taking my corgi, Gus, on a long walk along the :ocean:.

I also love cooking (and food in general :sushi: :pizza:).

My favourite quote is:
